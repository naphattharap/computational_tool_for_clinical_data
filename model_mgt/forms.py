 The formâ€™s is_bound attribute will tell you whether a form has data bound to it or not.
 Whatever the data submitted with a form, once it has been successfully validated by calling is_valid() 
 (and is_valid() has returned True), the validated form data will be in the form.cleaned_data dictionary. 
 This data will have been nicely converted into Python types for you
